🔍 Sentiment Analysis using BERT (PyTorch)
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained BERT model for multi-class sentiment classification using PyTorch. Completed as part of a Coursera Guided Project, the end-to-end pipeline covers everything from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, providing hands-on experience with real-world NLP workflows.
